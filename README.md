# Mapping CAC susceptibility loci to atherosclerotic plaques

Collaboration for mapping targets from the CHARGE Consortium 1000G GWAS on coronary artery calcification (CAC) with Maryam Kavousi and Maxime Bos.

**Athero-Express Biobank Study**
We have bulk RNAseq (n = 635 samples) and single-cell RNAseq data, genome-wide methylation (Illumina 450K) in n ± 600, as well as overlapping genetic data for ±2,100 individuals with extensive histological plaque characterisation. We will do the following:

- Gene expression correlated to characteristics of plaques?
- Where target genes expressed, which cell types? 
- Are any of the variants associated to plaque characteristics?

Ideally, we would like to map the variants to the expression and methylation data (molecular QTL mapping), but this is pending finalizing our molQTL mapping.

We expect new serum-based OLINK data (for the 'TO_AITION' projecty) in Q4 2020. We agreed that we would keep this in mind, we could run some additional analyses when asked during the revision stage of the manuscript.

- Correlation of variants to proteins from the OLINK-platform
