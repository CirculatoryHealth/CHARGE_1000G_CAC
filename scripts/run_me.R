# We recommend that you prepare your raw data for analysis in 'prepare_data.R',
# and end that file with either open_data(yourdata), or closed_data(yourdata).
# Then, uncomment the line below to load the original or synthetic data
# (whichever is available), to allow anyone to reproduce your code:
# load_data()
